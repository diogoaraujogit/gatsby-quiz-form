## Description
Group of forms made in Gatsby where, in some key questions, the user is directed to different forms according to their answer in that key question.

Example: the user must choose whether they are looking for an iPhone or a MacBook and then following questions to this one will be according to this answer. Check it out in the video.

The entire code structure of the project already existed and I was responsible for making only the necessary changes so that this project could receive different forms, so that the user can choose between them and so that each form can have different tracks.
